            Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night
            and leaving jokes all over the place: under the kings pillow, in his
            soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldnt
            seem to stop Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom
            discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they
            couldnt help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldnt
            stop.
